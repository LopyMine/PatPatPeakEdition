## 🎮 How it changes gameplay?
This isn't just a visual mod. Petting your friend will give them a small amount of your stamina 

— You lose stamina, your friend gain it.

So, if you're standing above or below them, you can help your friend climb up, truly working as a team!

The mod can be installed for everyone, or used as a client-side mod. 
**Stamina exchange can be disabled in the config.**

There's also a very small chance of a "Morale Boost". It simply removes a small amount of negative effects, and if there are none, it grants a large amount of stamina (this event is very rare).

For now, you can only pat players, zombies, and other humanoids characters, but more are planned for the future 😊

## ⚙ Configurable
Just letting you know that the addon is customizable, and you can configure everything you need through the mod config 🤗
